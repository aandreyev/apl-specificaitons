# Portal â€“ Contact Multiple Email Addresses

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
Enhancement to Portal's contact management system to support multiple email addresses per contact, replacing the current 3-field limitation with a flexible, status-based email management system.

### Business Justification
**Critical Problem**: When contacts change email addresses, historical email communications become "orphaned" and are lost from the unified communication view, breaking a core value proposition of the Portal system for legal case management.

**Business Impact**: Loss of complete client communication history affects legal matter management, compliance, and client service quality.

### Key Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Lawyers (coordinators, reviewers, team members) - 80% of usage
- **Secondary Users**: Business operations staff (invoicing, client support) - 20% of usage
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Development team, system administrators
- **Business Stakeholders**: Legal practice partners, compliance officers

### Success Criteria Summary
- 100% preservation of historical email data during migration
- 80%+ reduction in "missing email history" support tickets
- Seamless user experience with new multi-email management capabilities
- No degradation in system performance or email association processing

### Project Scope
**Included:**
- Migration from 3 email fields to separate email address table
- 5-status email management system (Primary, Invoice, Active, Dormant, Ignore)
- Updated email association batch processing
- New communications box UI with email management capabilities
- Complete codebase update across all identified integration points

**Excluded:**
- Changes to Microsoft 365 email download process
- Modifications to email deduplication logic
- Integration with external email systems beyond current M365 setup

## Current State

Currently each contact has up to 3 emails. All 3 emails are separate fields in the contact table.

The existing email fields are:
- Primary Email
- Secondary Email  
- Invoice Email

When the contact changes emails, one of these emails is replaced. The old replaced email is no longer recorded in portal.

## Technical Context: Email Association Process

Portal's core functionality provides a **unified communications view** by downloading all firm emails and associating them with contacts via email address matching. This enables lawyers and business operations staff to see complete communication history for each contact.

### Current Email Matching Process

- **Exact email address matching** against only the single `Email` field (Primary field only - Secondary and Invoice fields are currently ignored in matching)
- **Batch processing**: Emails downloaded and matched in batches every 1 hour via Hangfire background jobs within the main Portal application
- **Deduplication logic**: 
  - For emails to multiple staff members: First TO recipient wins, others discarded
  - For emails involving multiple contacts: Each contact gets their own copy of the email
- **User base**: Primarily lawyers (coordinators/reviewers/team members), with business operations staff using for invoicing and client support

### Integration with ALP System

- Portal is part of the ALP legal practice management system (.NET Core + Vue.js + PostgreSQL)
- Microsoft 365 email integration
- Emails stored in dedicated `emails` table with many-to-many contact associations via `ContactEmails` junction table
- Email communication displayed in contact's email tab for unified case management

## Security & Compliance Requirements

### Data Security Requirements

#### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- **Email Address Uniqueness**: Email addresses must be unique across entire system (all tenants)
- **Tenant Isolation**: Email associations must respect tenant boundaries
- **Access Control**: Users can only modify email addresses for contacts within their tenant
- **Audit Trail**: All email address changes must be logged with user, timestamp, and change details

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Email addresses stored using same encryption standards as existing contact data
- **PII Handling**: Email addresses treated as personally identifiable information (PII)
- **Access Logging**: Email address access and modifications logged for security auditing
- **Data Retention**: Email addresses subject to same retention policies as contact data

### Legal Industry Compliance

#### Communication Record Retention
- **Legal Requirement**: Complete client communication history must be maintained for regulatory compliance
- **Email Association Integrity**: System must ensure all historical emails remain associated with correct contacts
- **Audit Requirements**: Changes to email associations must be auditable for compliance reporting
- **Data Integrity**: Email communication links must be immutable once established

#### Regulatory Considerations
- **Client Confidentiality**: Email address changes must not compromise client confidentiality
- **Matter Management**: Email communication history critical for legal matter documentation
- **Professional Standards**: System must support legal professional communication record requirements
- **Trust Account Correlation**: Email communications may be linked to trust account transactions requiring preservation

### Security Constraints

#### Email Association Process Security
- **Batch Processing**: Email association process must maintain security controls during bulk operations
- **Error Handling**: Security-conscious error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Performance Monitoring**: Security monitoring of email association process for anomalies
- **Failsafe Mechanisms**: Security failsafes if email association process encounters errors

#### Integration Security
- **Microsoft 365**: Maintain existing security standards for M365 email integration
- **API Security**: Email management APIs must enforce same authentication/authorization as existing Portal APIs
- **Database Security**: New email table must implement same security controls as existing contact table

## Business Problem

The business problem is that when a contact changes email addresses, we lose sync with their old email addresses, and therefore old emails no longer show in the email communication tab.

Users want to see all emails that have gone to and from a contact, this includes emails to the contact's current email address, as well as former email addresses.

In addition, contacts often have more than one email address at the same time, but for different purposes. For example, some contacts want invoices sent to a different email address.

**Critical Impact**: When email addresses are overwritten, historical emails become "orphaned" and break the unified communication view essential for legal case management.

## Solution: Allowing for Multiple Email Addresses

We need to break the email fields into a separate table and create one-to-many relationships between contacts and emails.

We also need to attach a status to each email address, so users and portal know what email address to use for different purposes.

## Email Address Status

The email status is an attribute of an email record in the email address table.

We need to be able to designate the following address status:

- **Primary**: A single primary email address for most communications
- **Invoice**: A single email address to receive invoices â€“ only necessary if invoices are not to go to the Primary address
- **Active**: Other active email addresses used by the contact
- **Dormant**: Other dormant email addresses previously used by the contact but no longer used
- **Ignore**: Email addresses that should be completely excluded from email matching and communication processes

### Email Routing Rules

- Portal defaults to sending emails to the **Primary** address
- If the contact has an address with status **Invoice**, then invoices are sent to this address, and all other emails go to the Primary address
- If no invoice address exists, then invoices are sent to the Primary address by default
- Other **Active** addresses can still be used to communicate with the contact, and the system will capture emails to and from this address. However, the system will not use these addresses for general communications or for Invoice purposes
- The **Dormant** addresses are ones that the contact has used historically, but which they have deprecated and no longer use. The system will still associate emails to and from these addresses with the contact and display in the email communications tab. This will allow users to see all historical email communications with the contact, even at these old addresses. Dormant addresses remain active in the email matching process as contacts sometimes revert to using old email addresses
- **Ignore** addresses are completely excluded from all email matching processes and communication workflows. Use this status for email addresses that should never be processed by the system. If an existing email is changed to Ignore, it should not remove any existing associations, only not use this address in the future matching process.

### Email Address Constraints

- **Invoice Email Exception**: Invoice status email addresses **CAN be duplicated** across contacts to accommodate business scenarios (e.g., shared accountants, billing departments)
- **Unique Constraint for Non-Invoice Emails**: Primary, Active, Dormant, and Ignore status emails must remain unique across the system
- **Status Change Restriction**: Cannot change Invoice email to another status if that email address already exists elsewhere in the system
- **Resolution Path**: Users must delete Invoice email addresses rather than change their status if duplication conflict exists
- **Contact Without Email**: A contact can be established without an email address using the 'I do not have email address' checkbox

### Email Association Process Integration

The new multiple email address structure must integrate seamlessly with Portal's existing email association process:

- **Batch Email Matching**: The hourly batch process will search across ALL email addresses for a contact (Primary, Invoice, Active, Dormant) when associating downloaded emails
- **Ignore Status Exclusion**: Email addresses with "Ignore" status are completely excluded from the email matching process (on a go-forward basis, i.e. from when this status applies. There is no need to un-associate emails that have already been associated with the Contact)
- **Historical Matching**: Dormant email addresses continue to participate in email matching, as contacts sometimes revert to using previous email addresses
- **Multiple Contact Matching**: Invoice email addresses may match multiple contacts (e.g., shared accountant), resulting in the same email being associated with multiple contacts simultaneously
- **Enhanced Email Association**: Email matching may return multiple contacts for a single email address due to Invoice email duplication - all matched contacts receive email associations

### Performance Considerations

- **Expected Volume**: Most contacts have only one email address; expansion primarily accommodates invoice emails and dormant addresses from job changes
- **Resource Usage**: Email processing remains resource-intensive but not expected to be materially worse with separate email table
- **Potential Efficiency Gains**: Separate email table structure may improve email matching process efficiency compared to current 3-field approach from more detailed Contact table
- **Monitoring**: Continue existing resource monitoring during email association batch processing
- **Updated Matching Logic**: Email association process requires modification to query separate email table instead of contact table email fields

## Displaying Multiple Emails in the Contact Detail View

### Communications Box UI Design

Email addresses display within a **communications box** in the Contact detail view (alongside phone numbers) to accommodate multiple addresses:

**Display Order:**
1. `xxx@xxx.com (Primary)` [First]
2. `xxx@xxx.com (Invoice)` [Second in order]
3. `xxx@xxx.com (Active)` [Third in order]
4. `xxx@xxx.com (Active)` [Third in order]
5. `xxx@xxx.com (Dormant)` [After primary, invoice and active addressesâ€¦]
6. `xxx@xxx.com (Dormant)` [After primary, invoice and active addressesâ€¦]
7. `xxx@xxx.com (Ignore)` [Last in order]

### Performance & Display Constraints

- **Maximum Display**: Show up to **6 email addresses** in the communications box
- **Scrolling Interface**: Additional email addresses beyond 6 are accessible via scrolling. Adjust as necessary for optimal look and feel of UI and adopt best practices
- **Efficient Loading**: Contact detail view handles email table join without degrading page load performance
- **Database Query Optimization**: Single query to retrieve all contact email addresses with status

### Email Status Management

#### User Interface Controls

- **Add Email**: Users click a "+" button to add new email addresses
- **Delete Email**: Users click an inline delete button next to each email address (except Primary emails). Emails are soft-deleted in email table and data is retained
- **Status Changes**: Inline dropdown selector for each email address
- **Primary Email Protection**: Primary email addresses display without delete button and cannot be removed directly

#### Primary and Invoice Email Management

- **Locked Dropdowns**: Primary and Invoice statuses are **locked** in the dropdown and cannot be changed directly
- **Indirect Management**: To set a new Primary or Invoice email:
  1. Add a new email address and set status to Primary/Invoice, OR
  2. Change an existing email address status to Primary/Invoice
- **Automatic Demotion**: When a new Primary/Invoice is set, the existing Primary/Invoice automatically becomes Active
- **Single Constraint Enforcement**: System maintains exactly one Primary and one Invoice address through this automatic demotion process. No complex workflows are required to change these status

#### Status Rules

- You can have **unlimited Active, Dormant, and Ignore** addresses
- **Ignore** status should be used sparingly and only when an email address must be completely excluded from all system processes (on a go-forward basis from status change to Ignore)

#### Validation and Error Handling

- **Email Format**: Must be well-formed email address - **invalid emails are blocked from saving**
- **Uniqueness**: Email address must not already exist in the system
- **Seamless Primary/Invoice Changes**: No error messages needed for Primary/Invoice conflicts - system automatically handles demotion of existing Primary/Invoice to Active status

#### Email Deletion Rules

- **Primary Email Protection**: Primary email addresses **cannot be directly deleted**. To remove a Primary email: 1) Add a new email address and set status to Primary (existing Primary automatically becomes Active), 2) Delete the now-Active email address.
- **Non-Primary Deletion**: All other email statuses (Invoice, Active, Dormant, Ignore) can be directly deleted
- **No Email Constraint**: Contacts can exist without any email addresses (handled by checkbox during contact setup)

### Email Address Deletion Policy

When an email address is deleted from a contact, the system must handle existing email associations appropriately. This policy balances data integrity, legal compliance, and business requirements.

#### Core Principle: Preserve Communication History

**Default Behavior**: **Existing email associations are PRESERVED** when an email address is deleted.

**Business Justification**:
- Maintains complete communication history essential for legal case management
- Supports regulatory compliance for communication record retention
- Preserves audit trail for matter documentation
- Aligns with core Portal value proposition of unified communication view

#### Deletion vs Status Change Guidance

**Use Email Address Deletion When**:
- Do not want email as option in other areas of Portal
- Do not want email displayed in communications box - tidy up display
- Email address was incorrectly entered/associated with wrong contact
- Email address contains sensitive information that must be removed
- System cleanup of test/invalid data
[Conflict: As above that email associations are retained even after email delete. Delete will therefore not achieve some of these objectives, e.g. clean up, remove sensitive information, etc]

**Use Status Change to "Ignore" When**:
- Email address is no longer active but was legitimately used by contact
- Want to stop future email matching but preserve historical associations
- Client requests removal from communications but history must be maintained
- Temporary suppression of email address without losing associations

**Use Status Change to "Dormant" When**:
- Contact no longer uses email address but may revert to it
- Email address is historical but should remain searchable
- Want to maintain complete communication timeline

#### Email Deletion Business Rules

1. **Primary Email Exception**: Primary email addresses cannot be deleted - no delete button is displayed for Primary emails
2. **Association Preservation**: Existing email associations remain intact and continue to display in contact's email communication tab
3. **Search Functionality**: Deleted email addresses are removed from contact search but historical emails remain findable through contact
4. **Audit Trail**: Email address deletion is logged with timestamp, user, and reason
5. **Display Behavior**: Deleted email addresses no longer appear in contact's communications box
6. **Email Matching**: Deleted email addresses are permanently excluded from future email association batch processing

#### Deletion Confirmation Process

**Standard Deletion Confirmation**:
```
"Delete Email Address: [email@example.com]

This will remove the email address from the contact but preserve existing email communication history.

â€¢ This email address will no longer appear in the contact's email list  
â€¢ Future emails to/from this address will not be associated with this contact
â€¢ This action cannot be undone

Consider changing status to 'Ignore' instead if you want to stop future matching while keeping the email address visible.

[Cancel] [Change to Ignore] [Delete Email Address]"
```

**Primary Email Deletion Prevention**:
Primary email addresses have no delete button and cannot be selected for deletion. Users attempting to remove a Primary email are guided through the proper process:

```
"Primary Email Cannot Be Deleted

To remove this Primary email address:
1. Add a new email address and set its status to Primary
2. The current Primary will automatically become Active status  
3. You can then delete the Active email address if needed

[Add New Email Address] [Cancel]"
```

#### Special Considerations

**Legal Industry Requirements**:
- Email deletion must not compromise legal matter documentation
- Email deletion will occur as soft-delete in the email table
- Audit trail must support regulatory compliance requirements  
- Communication history preservation takes precedence over data cleanup

**Security Considerations**:
- Email address deletion removes PII from active contact data
- Historical email associations may still contain the email address in email metadata
- Consider data retention policies and right-to-be-forgotten requirements

**Technical Implementation**:
- Soft delete email address record (mark as deleted rather than hard delete)
- Maintain foreign key relationships to preserve email associations
- Update email association batch process to exclude deleted email addresses
- Ensure reporting and search functions respect deleted status

#### First Email Address Behavior

- **Automatic Primary Status**: When the first email is added to a contact with no existing emails, it automatically receives **Primary** status
- **Status Lock**: This first email's Primary status cannot be changed except by adding a new Primary email (which triggers automatic demotion to Active)

## Display of Emails Associated with a Contact

All emails to and from all addresses are associated with the Contact (Primary, Invoice, Active and Dormant) and are then displayed in the emails communication tab for the contact. This allows users to see all email correspondence with the Contact, no matter what address has been used. 

**This solves the business problem identified above.**

## Migration

### Data Migration Strategy

We need to migrate the 3 existing email fields into the new email table and associate with the same contact and relevant status:

- **Primary Email** â†’ **Primary** status
- **Secondary Email** â†’ **Active** status  
- **Invoice Email** â†’ **Invoice** status
- **Null/Empty fields** â†’ Ignored (no email record created)

### Pre-Migration Validation

- **Duplicate Check**: Run validation to identify any duplicate email addresses across different contacts before migration
- **Duplicate Resolution**: Manual review required for any duplicates found
  - If few duplicates: Manual resolution process
  - If many duplicates discovered: Build conflict resolution interface for bulk handling
- **Data Quality Check**: Verify existing email format validation is sufficient
- **Constraint Verification**: Ensure no data conflicts will violate the new uniqueness constraints

### Code Impact Analysis

Multiple components reference the current 3 email fields and will require updates:

- **Invoicing System**: Currently checks `invoice_email` field, falls back to `primary_email`  
- **Reports & Analytics**: Various reports reference email fields directly

- User workflow becomes materially more complex than current system

## Appendix: Critical Codebase Analysis Findings

### Documentation Corrections Made

During comprehensive codebase analysis of the ALP Portal system, several critical discoveries were made that required corrections to this specification:

#### **Email Processing Frequency Correction**
- **Original Assumption**: Email processing every ~20-30 minutes
- **Actual Implementation**: Email processing every **1 hour** via Hangfire scheduled job
- **Code Location**: `ALP/Startup.cs` line 190: `Cron.HourInterval(1)`
- **Impact**: Adjusted performance expectations and system load calculations

#### **Email Matching Logic Correction**
- **Original Assumption**: Email matching against all 3 email fields (Primary, Secondary, Invoice)
- **Actual Implementation**: Email matching **only against single `Email` field** (Primary field only)
- **Code Location**: `ALP.Services/Emails/EmailSyncService.cs` lines 135-155
- **Discovery**: Secondary and Invoice email fields are completely ignored in current matching process
- **Impact**: This makes the multi-email enhancement even more critical than initially understood

#### **System Architecture Correction**
- **Original Assumption**: Email processing runs on separate server
- **Actual Implementation**: Email processing runs as **Hangfire background jobs within main Portal application**
- **Code Location**: `ALP.Services/Hangfire/HangfireSyncUserEmailsJob.cs`
- **Impact**: Simplified deployment and operational complexity for enhancement

#### **Database Relationship Correction**
- **Original Assumption**: Direct `contact_id` foreign key in emails table
- **Actual Implementation**: **Many-to-many relationship** via `ContactEmails` junction table
- **Discovery**: Emails can be associated with multiple contacts simultaneously
- **Impact**: Confirmed enhancement approach aligns with existing architecture

### Key Technical Insights

#### **Exact Code Location for Multi-Email Enhancement**
The critical method requiring update for multi-email support:
```csharp
// Current implementation (EmailSyncService.cs lines 135-155)
public async Task AssignEmailToContacts(Email email, IEnumerable<EmailRecipient> recipients)
{
    // Only searches: _context.Contacts.Where(e => emailAddresses.Contains(e.Email.Trim().ToUpper()))
    // Missing: Secondary and Invoice email fields completely ignored
}
```

#### **Hangfire Job Configuration**
```csharp
// Startup.cs line 190
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate<HangfireSyncUserEmailsJob>(
    x => x.Execute(), 
    Cron.HourInterval(1), 
    new RecurringJobOptions { TimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.Local }
);
```

#### **Performance Characteristics Discovered**
- **Batch Size**: 10 emails per Microsoft Graph API call
- **Processing Method**: Sequential user processing, parallel email processing within user
- **Error Handling**: Individual email failures don't stop batch processing
- **Monitoring**: Available via `/hangfire` dashboard

### Implications for Enhancement Implementation

These findings confirm that:

1. **Enhancement is More Critical**: Current system misses even more emails than initially understood
2. **Implementation Scope**: No separate server deployment needed - all code is in main application
3. **Performance Impact**: 1-hour frequency provides sufficient processing window for new email table queries
4. **Architectural Alignment**: New multi-email table structure aligns perfectly with existing many-to-many relationship pattern

### Documentation Created

- **`EMAIL_PROCESSING_SYSTEM.md`**: Comprehensive documentation of current email processing system in `alp-business-logic` submodule
- **Specification Updates**: All timing, architecture, and processing details corrected based on actual codebase analysis
