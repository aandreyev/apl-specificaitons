# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Preparation Process

This guide outlines the step-by-step process for preparing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to support the development of enhancements to an existing software application. It is designed to be used interactively with an AI assistant to ensure all relevant areas are covered in a structured and efficient way.

---

## 1. Define the Enhancement

### 1.1. Name and Summary
- **Instruction to AI**: “Help me name this enhancement and write a 1-2 sentence summary of what it does and why it’s needed.”
- **Output**: Clear name and executive summary of the enhancement.

### 1.2. Problem Statement
- **Instruction to AI**: “Describe the current problem or limitation in the system this enhancement addresses.”
- **Output**: Concise problem definition that captures the user or business pain point.

### 1.3. Goals & Success Metrics
- **Instruction to AI**: “List the objectives of this enhancement and how we’ll measure success.”
- **Output**: Set of measurable goals (e.g. performance gains, user satisfaction, reduced manual effort).

## 2. Stakeholders & Users

### 2.1. Identify Stakeholders
- **Instruction to AI**: “List the key internal and external stakeholders who care about or will be impacted by this enhancement.”
- **Output**: Stakeholder list with roles and relevance.

### 2.2. Define User Personas
- **Instruction to AI**: “Define the types of users who will interact with or benefit from the enhancement.”
- **Output**: Persona descriptions including context of use.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Feature Description
- **Instruction to AI**: “Describe the main features that need to be added or modified.”
- **Output**: Clear list of features or changes with a short description of each.

### 3.2. User Stories
- **Instruction to AI**: “Write user stories in the format: ‘As a [persona], I want [feature] so that [benefit].’”
- **Output**: Set of user stories describing desired functionality.

### 3.3. Acceptance Criteria
- **Instruction to AI**: “List specific, testable conditions for each user story to be considered complete.”
- **Output**: Acceptance criteria mapped to each user story.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Performance & Scalability
- **Instruction to AI**: “Specify performance benchmarks or load requirements.”
- **Output**: Constraints or targets related to system behavior under load.

### 4.2. Security & Compliance
- **Instruction to AI**: “Describe any security, privacy, or regulatory requirements relevant to the enhancement.”
- **Output**: Description of applicable standards or expectations.

### 4.3. Compatibility
- **Instruction to AI**: “List any affected platforms, environments, or third-party integrations.”
- **Output**: Technical dependencies and compatibility notes.

---

## 5. UI/UX Requirements (if applicable)

### 5.1. Wireframes or Mockups
- **Instruction to AI**: “Generate or suggest sample wireframes or mockup descriptions for the UI changes.”
- **Output**: Visual or descriptive reference for the design.

### 5.2. Interaction Notes
- **Instruction to AI**: “Explain how the user will interact with the enhancement in step-by-step terms.”
- **Output**: Interaction flow narrative.

---

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1. System Impact
- **Instruction to AI**: “Which parts of the current architecture or codebase will be affected?”
- **Output**: Overview of components involved.

### 6.2. Data & APIs
- **Instruction to AI**: “Identify any changes to data models, APIs, or integrations.”
- **Output**: List of impacted or required schema/API changes.

---

## 7. Delivery Plan

### 7.1. Dependencies & Risks
- **Instruction to AI**: “List technical, scheduling, or resource risks and external dependencies.”
- **Output**: Risk register with mitigation strategies.

### 7.2. Timeline & Milestones
- **Instruction to AI**: “Propose a rough timeline with key milestones for implementation.”
- **Output**: Timeline estimate for planning purposes.

---

## 8. Review & Sign-Off

- **Instruction to AI**: “Generate a checklist to confirm readiness of this PRD for review.”
- **Output**: Review checklist including stakeholder approval and completeness check.

---

## Notes

- AI Assistant can reference previous enhancements, project docs, or technical architecture as needed.
- PRD should be versioned in source control and shared with the dev team for refinement.
